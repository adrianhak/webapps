# webapps

### To launch the project:
* Add project to Netbeans
* Create a derby database called "drinkdb"
* Connect to the database
* Build and run

This should build both the backend and the React frontend.
The app can be accessed at **localhost:8080/drink**.

### (Optional) To run React frontend separately on node server:
* Install Node and npm
* Navigate to %root%\webapps\src\main\webapp
* Run ```npm install```
* Run ```npm run start```
